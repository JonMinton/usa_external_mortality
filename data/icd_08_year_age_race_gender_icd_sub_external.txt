Caveats:
"1. About national population figures: population figures for 1968-69 and 1971-78 are intercensal estimates of the July 1"
"resident population; population figures for 1970 are April 1 modified census counts. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Population Information."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"3. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the number of live births"
"for the given time period. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
